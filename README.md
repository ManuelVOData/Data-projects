#  KNN Classifier â€“ Breast Cancer Diagnosis

This project applies a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification model to a breast cancer dataset.  
The model is trained using two selected features: `'mean area'` and `'mean compactness'`, with the target variable `'diagnosis'`.

##  Dataset

- 568 rows and 31 columns of patient data related to breast cancer diagnosis.
- This project uses a simplified version with two features and one target.
- The dataset is originally part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was provided for academic purposes.

##  Steps performed

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and scaling
3. Model training using KNN
4. Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

##  Results

- Best accuracy achieved: **0,84%**
- Accuracy varied depending on test size, providing insights into model performance under different conditions.

##  Technologies

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
